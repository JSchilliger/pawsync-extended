# Paw Sync Agent Instructions

## Project Overview
This project is "Paw Sync", a Flutter application for pet lifecycle management. Key technologies include Flutter, Riverpod, GoRouter, and Firebase.

## IMPORTANT SETUP NOTE FOR USER:
Due to limitations with the automated tooling environment, the agent cannot reliably run `flutter create` or `flutter pub get` without encountering issues that roll back changes.

**After the agent completes the initial file and directory structure setup, YOU WILL NEED TO MANUALLY:**

1.  **Navigate to the `paw_sync` directory in your terminal.**
2.  **Run `flutter pub get`**. This will fetch all the necessary dependencies defined in `pubspec.yaml` and generate essential platform-specific files and the `.dart_tool` directory.
3.  **Install FlutterFire CLI if you haven't already: `dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli`**
4.  **Run `flutterfire configure`** from the `paw_sync` directory. This command will guide you to select your Firebase project and will generate `lib/firebase_options.dart` which is crucial for initializing Firebase. Ensure you select the correct Firebase project and platforms (iOS, Android, Web if applicable).
5.  **If core platform directories (`android`, `ios`, `linux`, `macos`, `windows`, `web`) or other essential project files like `analysis_options.yaml` are missing after the previous steps, you might also need to run `flutter create . --project-name paw_sync` (note the dot) INSIDE the `paw_sync` directory.** This command will generate any missing platform-specific boilerplate and project files without overwriting your `lib` content, `pubspec.yaml`, or `README.md` if they already exist with content.

The agent has written `lib/main.dart` to include Firebase initialization code expecting `firebase_options.dart` to be available after you complete these steps.

## Development Guidelines
1.  **Documentation:**
    *   **Inline Comments:** Add detailed comments directly in the code. Explain the purpose of each file, class, method, and any complex logic.
    *   **README.md:** The root `README.md` should be continuously updated to document the project's purpose, how to run it, and provide an overview of the architecture.
2.  **Project Structure:** Adhere to the feature-first architecture. All files related to a specific feature (e.g., pet profiles) should be located within their own directory (e.g., `lib/features/pet_profile/`). This directory should contain sub-folders for screens, widgets, providers, and models as needed.
3.  **Core Files:**
    *   `lib/main.dart`: Main application entry point. Initialized with Firebase, basic routing, theme, and localization.
    *   `lib/core/routing/app_router.dart`: Centralized GoRouter configuration. Basic structure with placeholder routes exists.
    *   `lib/core/theme/theme.dart`: Application design system (colors, fonts, styles). Basic structure with placeholder theme exists.
    *   `lib/core/localization/l10n/`: Directory containing ARB files for internationalization (e.g., `app_en.arb`, `app_fr.arb`). These files exist with basic translations.
    *   `l10n.yaml`: Configuration file for Flutter's localization generation tool. This file exists.
    *   Note: After running `flutter pub get`, the user might need to run `flutter gen-l10n` (or it might run automatically with hooks) to generate/update `lib/core/localization/generated/app_localizations.dart` (or similar path based on `l10n.yaml` output settings, by default it's in `.dart_tool/...` and imported via `package:flutter_gen/gen_l10n/app_localizations.dart`).
4.  **Firebase Setup:** Firebase configuration files (`google-services.json`, `GoogleService-Info.plist`) are managed by the user. Assume they are correctly placed for platform builds. Firebase initialization should occur in `main.dart` using `firebase_options.dart` (which is generated by the user running `flutterfire configure`).
5.  **State Management (Riverpod):** Use Riverpod providers for state management. For complex states, prefer `StateNotifierProvider` or `AsyncNotifierProvider`.
6.  **Dependencies:** Add new dependencies to `paw_sync/pubspec.yaml`.
7.  **Testing:** Add relevant unit, widget, and integration tests for new features or bug fixes.
8.  **Commits:** Use descriptive commit messages. For larger features, break them down into smaller, logical commits.

## Sandbox / Tooling Notes
*   The Flutter SDK is installed at `/tmp/flutter_sdk/flutter`. Ensure `$PATH` includes `/tmp/flutter_sdk/flutter/bin`.
