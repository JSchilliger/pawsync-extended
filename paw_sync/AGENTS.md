# Paw Sync Agent Instructions

## Project Overview
This project is "Paw Sync", a Flutter application for pet lifecycle management. Key technologies include Flutter, Riverpod, GoRouter, and Firebase.

## IMPORTANT SETUP NOTE FOR USER (AND AGENT AWARENESS):
This project requires significant manual setup by the user after initial code generation by the agent. These steps are due to limitations in the automated tooling environment, especially concerning `flutter pub get`, Firebase configuration, and platform-specific file generation.

**The user MUST perform these steps locally.** A comprehensive guide for the user is available in:
➡️ **[MANUAL_SETUP_AND_NEXT_STEPS.md](MANUAL_SETUP_AND_NEXT_STEPS.md)** ⬅️

**Agent Actions and Assumptions:**
*   The agent should assume that dependencies listed in `pubspec.yaml` (like Firebase SDKs, Riverpod, GoRouter) are **not immediately available** in its environment after adding them. Code completion and analysis based on these packages might not work until the user runs `flutter pub get`.
*   The agent should **not** attempt to run `flutter pub get` or `flutterfire configure` directly, as these often cause issues or rollbacks in restricted environments.
*   The agent should write code (e.g., Firebase initializations, repository implementations) assuming these dependencies *will be* available after the user performs the manual steps.
*   The file `lib/firebase_options.dart` is critical for Firebase initialization and is generated by the user running `flutterfire configure`. The agent should not create this file.
*   Similarly, generated localization files (e.g., from `flutter gen-l10n`) are also user-generated.

**Summary of User's Manual Steps (details in the linked .md file):**
1.  Run `flutter pub get`.
2.  Run `flutter gen-l10n`.
3.  Install FlutterFire CLI (`dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli`) if needed.
4.  Run `flutterfire configure`.
5.  Potentially run `flutter create . --project-name paw_sync` for missing platform files.
6.  Place Firebase config files (`google-services.json`, `GoogleService-Info.plist`) if needed.

The agent has prepared `lib/main.dart` and other parts of the application expecting these manual steps to be completed by the user.

## Development Guidelines
1.  **Documentation:**
    *   **Inline Comments:** Add detailed comments directly in the code. Explain the purpose of each file, class, method, and any complex logic.
    *   **README.md:** The root `README.md` should be continuously updated to document the project's purpose, how to run it, and provide an overview of the architecture.
2.  **Project Structure:** Adhere to the feature-first architecture. All files related to a specific feature (e.g., pet profiles) should be located within their own directory (e.g., `lib/features/pet_profile/`). This directory should contain sub-folders for screens, widgets, providers, and models as needed.
3.  **Core Files:**
    *   `lib/main.dart`: Main application entry point. Initialized with Firebase, basic routing, theme, and localization.
    *   `lib/core/routing/app_router.dart`: Centralized GoRouter configuration. Basic structure with placeholder routes exists.
    *   `lib/core/theme/theme.dart`: Application design system (colors, fonts, styles). Basic structure with placeholder theme exists.
    *   `lib/core/localization/l10n/`: Directory containing ARB files for internationalization (e.g., `app_en.arb`, `app_fr.arb`). These files exist with basic translations.
    *   `l10n.yaml`: Configuration file for Flutter's localization generation tool. This file exists.
    *   Note: After running `flutter pub get`, the user might need to run `flutter gen-l10n` (or it might run automatically with hooks) to generate/update `lib/core/localization/generated/app_localizations.dart` (or similar path based on `l10n.yaml` output settings, by default it's in `.dart_tool/...` and imported via `package:flutter_gen/gen_l10n/app_localizations.dart`).
4.  **Firebase Setup:** Firebase configuration files (`google-services.json`, `GoogleService-Info.plist`) are managed by the user. Assume they are correctly placed for platform builds. Firebase initialization should occur in `main.dart` using `firebase_options.dart` (which is generated by the user running `flutterfire configure`).
5.  **State Management (Riverpod):** Use Riverpod providers for state management. For complex states, prefer `StateNotifierProvider` or `AsyncNotifierProvider`.
6.  **Dependencies:** Add new dependencies to `paw_sync/pubspec.yaml`.
7.  **Testing:** Add relevant unit, widget, and integration tests for new features or bug fixes.
8.  **Commits:** Use descriptive commit messages. For larger features, break them down into smaller, logical commits.

## Sandbox / Tooling Notes
*   The Flutter SDK is installed at `/tmp/flutter_sdk/flutter`. Ensure `$PATH` includes `/tmp/flutter_sdk/flutter/bin`.
