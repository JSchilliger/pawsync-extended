# Paw Sync - Pet Lifecycle Management App

## Project Purpose

Paw Sync is a comprehensive, user-centric mobile application for pet owners (dogs, cats, NAC/exotic pets). It aims to serve as a complete lifecycle management platform for pets, connecting owners with essential services and information. The user experience will prioritize being clean, intuitive, and secure.

## 🚀 Critical Setup Instructions 🚀

**This project requires manual setup steps before it can be run locally.**

Due to limitations in automated environments, several crucial commands and configurations must be performed by you.

👉 **Please refer to the detailed guide: [MANUAL_SETUP_AND_NEXT_STEPS.md](MANUAL_SETUP_AND_NEXT_STEPS.md)** 👈

This guide covers:
*   Essential terminal commands (`flutter pub get`, `flutter gen-l10n`, `flutterfire configure`, etc.)
*   Firebase project creation and configuration (including `google-services.json` and `GoogleService-Info.plist`).
*   Key placeholders in the code that need your attention for full functionality.
*   Potential next steps in development.

**Quick Summary of Key Commands (see the guide above for full details):**
1.  `flutter pub get`
2.  `flutter gen-l10n`
3.  `dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli` (if needed)
4.  `flutterfire configure`

The agent has prepared the codebase with foundational elements including Firebase initialization in `main.dart`, theming, localization, basic routing, data models, and repository structures. Completing the manual setup will make these functional.

## Core Technologies & Architecture

This project is built using Flutter for cross-platform mobile development.

*   **State Management**: [Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev/) is used for all state management.
*   **Navigation**: [go_router](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router) manages all routing and navigation. All app routes are defined in `lib/core/routing/app_router.dart`.
*   **Backend**: Firebase is the chosen Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) for Authentication, Cloud Firestore (database), and Firebase Cloud Storage (file storage).
*   **Project Structure**: A feature-first architecture is adopted.
*   **Internationalization (i18n)**: Uses `flutter_localizations` and `intl`. ARB files are in `lib/core/localization/l10n/` (e.g., `app_en.arb`, `app_fr.arb`). `l10n.yaml` configures string generation.
*   **Design System**: A central `theme.dart` file (`lib/core/theme/theme.dart`) defines the application's design system (colors, fonts, text styles).

## How to Run

1.  **Ensure Flutter is installed:** Follow the [official Flutter installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
2.  **COMPLETE THE CRITICAL SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:** Refer to **[MANUAL_SETUP_AND_NEXT_STEPS.md](MANUAL_SETUP_AND_NEXT_STEPS.md)**. This is essential.
3.  **Run the app (after setup):**
    ```bash
    cd paw_sync
    flutter run
    ```
    (Specific run commands for different flavors or emulators/devices will be added later as needed).
